# Spotify-analysis
 Exploring Spotify's API and using the `spotipy` package to generate recommended playlists and analyse the music metadata.
 
 * Can search for up to five "seed" songs, and generate a recommended playlist based on them.
 
 * Can see your top-played songs over "short-term", "medium-term", and "long-term" time periods.
 
 * Created functions to simplify the extraction of the required metadata for a track and accessing/displaying search results. This was done because Spotify has an extremely large amount of metadata for each track, and getting the data that you require can be quite complicated, messy, and time-consuming.
